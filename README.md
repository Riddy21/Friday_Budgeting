# Inspiration...
In these difficult economic times, many of us are looking to improve our financial behavior. So we may look for a budgeting app to help alleviate our financial stress. Unfortunately, by and large, these apps just don’t work. In an American Psychological Association (APA) survey, Stress in America, 6 of 10 U.S. adults said their biggest personal stressor is money and the lack of financial literacy cost Americans $415 billion in 2020. Why is that?

Confusing complexity: For many apps, the bells and whistles can be unnecessarily complicated. It becomes time consuming to figure out the array of labels, tags and hashtags to sort out transactions.

Miscategorizations: Apps like Mint also cannot process nuanced transactions and require maintenance to stay accurate. A bag of flaming hot Cheetos at the gas station is categorized as gas, and Amazon purchases — which could be almost anything — are just “online shopping.” Not to mention paying back friends using e-transfer of cash. None of that is captured.

Lack of other Resources: There were also no other resources outside of tracking spending. The information is backwards looking and does not provide actionable advice for the future besides just stop spending.

Lack of Accountability: Over time, notifications get lost in the myriad of other alerts and eventually the user stops checking them altogether.

Guilt-inducing: It feels like budgeting = guilt about spending. It tells you that spending is bad and to stop doing it. It nags you when you go over budget, until you eventually decide to ignore it. Often, it feels like the budget is controlling you, rather than the other way around.

We decided that there has got to be a better way.


# How we built it...
Friday’s technology stack is as follows: 1. Python: The beloved application development language of Friday. 2. Django: Friday’s Python based back-end server and database. 3. Twilio: Friday uses Twilio API to send and receive SMS. 4. RESTful API: Friday uses a custom built REST API to handle it’s core functionalities 5. GPT-3: Friday leverages OpenAI’s state of the art AI model with over 175 Billion parameters.

# Next Steps
We would love to see our assistant Friday to be able to be a standalone Service that can be integrated into any situation where speaking or texting is the key way of communication. We would like to be able to integrate her functionality into chat and services like Discord, websites, iOS apps, or even Amazon Alexa! And the other big improvement we’d like to make would be to enable Friday to understand conversation from multiple people at once and group budgeting.
